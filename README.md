# XSharpX

XSharpX is a general library for functional programming using .NET languages.

It provides purely functional data structures to complement those from
the BCEL. There is an intention is to integrate with several .NET
languages such as [F#](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fsharp/),
[Cω](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/comega/)
and [Nemerle](http://nemerle.org/About/) for the purpose of demonstrating
capability. At this moment, XSharpX uses C# exclusively for implementation.


## Quick Start

```c#
using XSharpX;
// ...
```

## Contributing

The XSharpX project is open to contributors. The project uses an open
policy, similar to projects such as [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz)
for Scala. Simply, if you have something interesting or useful to add,
you're in. This policy has been highly successful in other OSS projects
and duplicating it for XSharpX is a desired goal.
